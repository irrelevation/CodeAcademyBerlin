        <h1>About Us</h1>
        <p>The meaning of the term “Section 8” derives from the United States military, and is a category of discharge from
        service, used for those judged mentally unfit or simply “different”: cross-dressers, homosexuals, bisexuals and
        transgenders.</p>
        <p>Indeed, we are “different”. It is hard to imagine a stranger group than the Section 8 crew: some of us are DJs, others
        are promoters, yet all of us are sworn ravers – products of the Berliner electronic music scene. Like many things that
        take shape with movement, we never really stopped to define our goals, targets or direction. From one colorful event
        series to the other, each of us shaped their own way, and together we all found different points of connection that draw
        us into one memorable night after the other, all with one common denominator: love for electronic music and the
        ever-free-spirited Berliner underground scene.</p>
        <p>Being home to several talented DJs and producers, we never wished to draw hard definitions in terms of musical style.
        Just like our events, we believe in diversity and energy: from classic and Tech House to pounding, hypnotic Techno. From
        endless backstage rendezvous to crazy roadtrips and showcases. The one element that connects all dots is ENERGY. No
        minimalism, no DDM (Drug Dependent Music). With us, it is all about movement.</p>
        <p>Meet Section 8. Berlin’s finest and strangest crew. You’ll never get bored.</p>
